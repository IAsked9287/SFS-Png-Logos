# SFS-Png-Logos
Adds more textures to Spaceflight Simulator specifically png ones

I reccomend using these as fairings and not fuel tanks to overlap fuel tanks which is the purpose of the logos, use a bp editor mod or just normal bp editing to resize the textures to your liking.

This pack indludes:

Brazilian Space Agency Logo

Italian Space Agency Logo

Australian Space Agency Logo

Blank transparent texture (just because)

Blue Origin Logo

Canadian Space Agency Logo

French Space Agency Logo
