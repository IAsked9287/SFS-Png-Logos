# SFS-Png-Logos
Adds more textures to Spaceflight Simulator specifically png ones

**BP editing is highly advised, and some textures might not work with (ex: size 4 fuel tanks so use Bp editing**)

****FYI: THIS ONLY WORKS WITH BASIC FUEL TANKS (resize basic fuel tanks to desired size then use the texture)****

**I reccommend using these as fairings and not fuel tanks to overlap fuel tanks which is the purpose of the logos, use a bp editor mod or just normal bp editing to resize the textures to your liking.**
