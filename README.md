# SFS-Png-Logos
Adds more textures to Spaceflight Simulator specifically png ones

Do not change/ edit anything without knowing what your doing

**Make sure to vary the shape texture because due to sfs limitations png textures are not really supported and sometimes a png texture might not work for some shape textures sometimes**

**BP editing is highly advised, and some textures might not work with (ex: size 4 fuel tanks so use Bp editing**)

**I recommend using these as fairings and not fuel tanks to overlap fuel tanks which is the purpose of the logos, use a bp editor mod or just normal bp editing to resize the textures to your liking.**
